ðŸ“¸ AI-Powered Face Recognition & Multi-Factor Security System ðŸš€
Security is evolving, and AI-driven facial recognition is leading the charge. This system doesnâ€™t just detect facesâ€”it identifies, verifies, and tracks multiple users in real-time, ensuring seamless authentication and intrusion detection.

âš¡ How It Works:
ðŸ”¹ AI-Powered Face Recognition & Multi-Face Detection

Captures live video feeds and detects faces using the face_recognition library.
Encodes facial features into 128D embeddings and compares them against a predefined database.
If a match is found, the user's identity is verified, and their image is saved in the "Photos" directory.
If no match is found, the face is flagged as an intrusion, and the image is logged in the "Intrusion" directory for security review.
ðŸ”¹ Real-Time Multi-Face Recognition & Attendance Logging

Supports simultaneous detection of multiple faces, making it ideal for offices, secure facilities, and attendance tracking.
Recognised individuals are logged with timestamps, ensuring automated attendance management.
Unknown individuals are immediately flagged and stored separately for further analysis.
ðŸ”¹ IoT-Enabled Security & Access Control (Arduino Integration)

Recognised users trigger an Arduino-controlled authentication system, sending unique access codes based on their identity.
Face recognition alone isnâ€™t enoughâ€”users must verify their fingerprint & enter a unique passcode before gaining access.
If fingerprint or passcode verification fails, the system immediately alerts law enforcement and logs the breach.
ðŸŽ¯ Key Features:
âœ… AI-Powered Facial Recognition â€“ Detects, verifies, and logs faces in real-time.
âœ… Multi-Face Detection & Attendance Tracking â€“ Supports multiple users simultaneously.
âœ… Intrusion Detection & Logging â€“ Unknown faces are flagged, captured, and stored for security analysis.
âœ… IoT-Enabled Access Control â€“ Recognised users trigger Arduino-based security checks before gaining access.
âœ… Multi-Layer Authentication â€“ Requires Face ID, Fingerprint, and Passcode for full security clearance.
âœ… Automated Security Alerts â€“ Failed authentication attempts notify law enforcement in real-time.

ðŸ”¥ Why This Matters?
Security isnâ€™t just about monitoringâ€”itâ€™s about intelligent, real-time access control. This system eliminates unauthorised access, automates identity tracking, and ensures multi-factor authentication for maximum security. Whether for corporate security, automated attendance, or smart home integration, this AI + IoT system is built to protect.
